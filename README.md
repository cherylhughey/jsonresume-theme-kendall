# JSON Parsed Resume

:construction: This is a resume experiment derived from the Kendall theme from the JSON Resume project. It was first parsed in JSON and rendered to a singular HTML webfile on the localhost. The CDNs for Bootstrap and FontAwesome dropped in to this repository in order to render it to a GitHub page and all development files were removed. This repository is NOT currently following HTML5 scaffolding guidelines at present with a separate folder for CSS and JS. The goal is to simply see how much I can change within the HTML file itself when Bootstrap is added to the mix.
