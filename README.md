# JSON Parsed Resume

:construction: This is a resume experiment derived from the Kendall theme by M. Adam Kendall from the JSON Resume project. It was first parsed in JSON and rendered to a singular HTML webfile on the localhost. The CDNs for Bootstrap and FontAwesome dropped in to this repository in order to render it to a GitHub page and all development files were removed. This repository is NOT currently following HTML5 scaffolding guidelines at present with separate folders for CSS and JS. The goal is to simply see how much I can change within the HTML file itself when Bootstrap is added to the mix.
